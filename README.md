## HOW TO WORK WITH SUBMODULES?
IF YOU ARE EDITING A MODULE FROM THE LEVEL OF MAIN REPOSITORY, RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMAND:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
OR
```
git submodule update --remote
```
IT WILL PULL THE SUBMODULES.<br><br>
TO COMMIT CHANGES, YOU HAVE TO:
1. COMMIT CHANGES IN THE SUBMODULE.
2. COMMIT CHANGE IN THE MAIN REPOSITORY.
## RECOMMENDED: WORK IN THE SUBMODULES, NOT THE MAIN REPOSITORY!
